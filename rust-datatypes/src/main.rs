//TRAITS
//a trait is a contract that requires a type support one or more methods
//traits establish consistency between types; methods that represent the same behaviour have the same name (across different types)
//so methods that represent the same fundamental behaviour can have the same name across different types.
//we say the type "implements" the trait.
//a type can choose to opting in to implementing a trait
//a type can implement multiple traits. there are hundrads of traits available in Rust.
//a trait is called an "INTERFACE" or protocol in other programming languages.

/*
the DISPLAY trait - requires that a type can be represented as a user friendly, readable string.
the display trait mandates a format method that returns the string.
when we use the {} interpolation syntax, Rust relies on the format method.
integers, floats and booleans all implement the display trait so we are able to interpolate them with curly braces
-not all types implement the Display trait, one example is the array type.
*/

THE DEBUG TRAIT - to format a given type into a porgrammer-facing string for the purposes of debugging.
