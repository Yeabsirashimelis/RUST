/*
SLICES
- a collection type is one of that can hold multiple values.
- arrays, tuples and strings are collection types.
- a slice is a reference to a portion/ sequence of a collection type. it is a subcategory of reference.
- a STRING SLICE is a reference to a sequence of characters from a string.
- an ARRAY SLICE is a reference to a sequence of elements form an array
- as a reference, a sllice does not take ownership of the collection. it just borrows portion of// chunk of the collection.

* so in real world example :- if you borrow the bedroom, corridor or the whole of my house.
so if it refers the whole collection it will be equivalent with references.
